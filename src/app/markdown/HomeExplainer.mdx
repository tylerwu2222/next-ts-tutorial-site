This is a site where I explore + showcase the capabilities of Next.js, Typescript, Prisma, and MDX.

**Disclaimer:** I am by no means a professional, in fact, I am probably novice-intermediate at these technologies. 
So, apologies in advance if there are any typos or oversimplifications of concepts.

This is mostly a way for me to document my own learning in a more concrete way: 
creating a website with my notes on Next.js and Typescript -- while using Next.js and typescript.

(Quite an inception sort of scenario.)

Anyway, hope this is helpful.
