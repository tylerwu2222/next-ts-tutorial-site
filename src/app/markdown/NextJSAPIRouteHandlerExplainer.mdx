## API routes
On this page, I'll walk through working with Next.js' API routes, (I need the practice too).

### An example
In a past techinical interview, I was asked to render data from this 
<a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API" target="_blank"><b>hackernews api</b></a>,
specifically, displaying the current <a href="https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json?print=pretty" target="_blank"><b>top stories</b></a>. 

During the interview, I was a little bit stumped because this problem required two instances of fetching the data:
first, I had to fecth all (or some) of the *ids* from the top stories link, then individually fetch top stories by ID with:
`https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/${id}.json?print=pretty;`

(I also forgot about `use client` and floundered for 10 out of the 20 minutes because nerves, but we don't talk about that.)

Shortly after the interview, I figured it all out, albiet with fetching the data directly from the component, 
but now I'll redo the problem with a more calm mindset.

#### Setting up the API routes
Here is how I set up 
<DefaultImg filename={'routes_directory.png'}/>

The `route.ts` under topstories will return the list of ID's from. 
Then I use those ID's along with the `route.ts` under `topstories/[id]` to get the individual story data.

Here are the first 5 ids (fetched from our api router):
<HackerNewsUnstyled/>

the api route handler code for getting the IDs:
```
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET() {
    const res = await fetch('https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json?print=pretty', {
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
      })
      const storyIDs = await res.json()
      return NextResponse.json(storyIDs)
}

```

and for getting the content for a specific ID (note the use of `params`):

```
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET(
    req: Request,
    { params }: { params: { id: string } }
) {
    const res = await fetch(`https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/${params.id}.json?print=pretty`)
    const storyContent = await res.json()
    return NextResponse.json(storyContent)

}
```

and the `useEffects` used for fetching from the route handler:
```
...
    const [topStoriesIDs, setTopStoriesIDs] = useState<Array<string>>([]);
    const [topStoriesContents, setTopStoriesContents] = useState<Array<storyType>>([]);
    useEffect(() => {
        const getTopStoryIDS = async () => {
            const res = await fetch('/api/hackernews/topstories',
                {
                    method: 'GET'
                }
            )
            const topStoryIDsData = await res.json();
            setTopStoryIDs(topStoryIDsData);
        }

        getTopStoryIDS();
    }, []);

     // get stories when IDs change
    useEffect(() => {
        const getTopStoriesContents = async () => {

            const getTopStoryContent = async (id:string) => {
                const res = await fetch(`/api/hackernews/topstories/${id}`,
                    {
                        method: 'GET'
                    }
                )
                const topStoryContentData = await res.json();
                return topStoryContentData;
            }

            const topStoriesContentsData = await Promise.all(topStoriesIDs.map(id=>getTopStoryContent(id)));
            setTopStoriesContents(topStoriesContentsData);
        };

        getTopStoriesContents();
    }, [topStoriesIDs]);
...
```

#### Adding pagination and styling
Sometimes, there is a large, large, large, amount of data and you don't want to load all of it when a user opens your site.
One way to deal with this is loading the first chunk of it, and as the user scrolls or goes to the next page,
progressively load more data.

To implement pagination and also to elevate the pages out of the 2000's into 2024, I styled with Mantine:

(You can read more about more of my favorite Mantine components <a href='/learning/typescript'><b>here</b></a>).

Here is a component handling that:
<HackerNews/>

```
