### Fetching data from server-side vs client-side components
Fetching data in NextJS is a bit different from React. 
Typically with React, I've used useEffect() with an async function with fetch to get data from an API.

Next.js, however lets you create your own API with its Route Handlers (API routes), similar to how the app router works.
By creating a `route.ts` file within a folder called `api` (and any subfolders, which will define the api route), 
you can create any HTTP requests within that `route.ts` file, and fetch them as you would an external api: `const res = await fetch('/api/todos');`.

But, before jumping into that, I wanted to explore something else specific to Next: a *server-side* component, (remember components in Next.js are server-side by default). 

For example, the following component is a Server Component that fetches dummy todo data from MockAPI **without** a client-side useEffect.

<TodosServerSide/>

This data is fully fetched from the server, and included in the page, fully loaded, before being sent to the client.
This is known as [static rendering](#static-vs-dynamic-rendering).

On the other hand, this component below is rendered on the client-side:

(You'll notice if you <RefreshPageButton/> this page, the server-side component's data looks like it does not change (since it's loaded before the page),
whereas the data in the client-side component has a delay since it's fetching the data on page load, rather than before.)

<TodosClientSide/>


Here is the code for both components:

**Server side:**
```
export default async function TodosServerSide() {
  // it's better practice to move your api logic within the api layer (in case API secrets), 
  // but I'm including it here directly b/c lazy
  const todosResponse = await fetch(
    'https://{my-key}.mockapi.io/api/todos', 
  { cache: "force-cache" });
  const todosData = await todosResponse.json()

  // this will log in the server (VS code) console
  console.log('todos json', todosData.length, todosData[0]);

  return (
    <div className={styles.todosContainer}>
      <b>Todos (server-side):</b>
      {todosData.map((todo:TodoType) => {
        return (
          <div>
            <p>{todo.title}</p>
          </div>
        )
      })}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Client Side:**
```
export default function TodosClientSide() {
    const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchTodos = async () => {
            // again, should handle this in next api routes
            const todosResponse = await fetch(
              'https://{my-key}.mockapi.io/api/todos',
              { cache: "force-cache" });
            const todosData = await todosResponse.json()
            setTodos(todosData);
        };
        fetchTodos();
    }, []);

    // this will log in the client console
    console.log('todos json', todos.length, todos[0]);

    return (
        <div className={styles.todosContainer}>
            <b>Todos (client-side):</b>
            {todos.map((todo: TodoType) => {
                return (
                    <div>
                        <p>{todo.title}</p>
                    </div>
                )
            })}
        </div>
    )
}
```

### Deciding between static and dynamic rendering
**static rendering:** uses caching to serve "static" content to user. 
This makes the site faster, reduces server load, and helps with SEO.

Should be used when:
    - there is no *shared* data between users. 
    - it's important to have the most 'live' version of the data
    - if users are constantly interacting with the same data, dynamic rendering may be the better choice

**dynamic rendering:** renders on the server each time the user makes a request (page is loaded, user refreshes the page).

Should be used when:
    - helps with keeping data up-to-date
    - if data needs to interact with info from request-time (cookies & url search params)
