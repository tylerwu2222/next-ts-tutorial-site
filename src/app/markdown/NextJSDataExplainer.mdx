### Fetching Data from a remote API
Fetching data in NextJS is a bit different from React. 
Typically with React, I've used useEffect() with an async function with fetch to get data from an API.

However, with Next, we can do this in a *server-side* component (remember components in Next are server side by default). 

For example, the following component is a Server Component that fetches dummy todo data from MockAPI **without** a client-side useEffect.

<TodosServerSide/>

This data is fully fetched from the server, and included in the page, fully loaded, before being sent to the client.
This is known as [static rendering](#static-vs-dynamic-rendering).

On the other hand, this component below is rendered on the client-side:

(You'll notice if you <RefreshPageButton/> this page, the server-side component's data looks like it does not change (since it's loaded before the page),
whereas the data in the client-side component has a delay since it's fetching the data on page load, rather than before.)

<TodosClientSide/>


Here is the code for both components:

**Server side:**
```
export default async function TodosServerSide() {
  const todosResponse = await fetch('https://66e366cd494df9a478e51d2e.mockapi.io/api/todos', { cache: "force-cache" });
  const todosData = await todosResponse.json()

  // this will log in the server (VS code) console
  console.log('todos json', todosData.length, todosData[0]);

  return (
    <div className={styles.todosContainer}>
      <b>Todos (server-side):</b>
      {todosData.map((todo:TodoType) => {
        return (
          <div>
            <p>{todo.title}</p>
          </div>
        )
      })}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Client Side:**
```
export default function TodosClientSide() {
    const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchTodos = async () => {
            const todosResponse = await fetch('https://66e366cd494df9a478e51d2e.mockapi.io/api/todos', { cache: "force-cache" });
            const todosData = await todosResponse.json()
            setTodos(todosData);
        };
        fetchTodos();
    }, []);

    // this will log in the client console
    console.log('todos json', todos.length, todos[0]);

    return (
        <div className={styles.todosContainer}>
            <b>Todos (client-side):</b>
            {todos.map((todo: TodoType) => {
                return (
                    <div>
                        <p>{todo.title}</p>
                    </div>
                )
            })}
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Deciding between static and dynamic rendering
**static rendering:** uses caching to serve "static" content to user. 
This makes the site faster, reduces server load, and helps with SEO.

Should be used when:
    - there is no *shared* data between users. 
    - it's important to have the most 'live' version of the data
    - if users are constantly interacting with the same data, dynamic rendering may be the better choice

**dynamic rendering:** renders on the server each time the user makes a request (page is loaded, user refreshes the page).

Should be used when:
    - helps with keeping data up-to-date
    - if data needs to interact with info from request-time (cookies & url search params)
