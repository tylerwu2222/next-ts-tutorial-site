### Images
Images in NextJS are a bit different from your typical `<img>` tag. 
A Next.js `<Image>` includes a bit of built-in optimization. 
Here is a short list of the things `<Image>` automatically does for you, directly from <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/optimizing-fonts-images" target='_blank'><b>Learn Next.js</b></a>

- Ensure your image is responsive on different screen sizes.
- Specify image sizes for different devices.
- Prevent layout shift as the images load.
- Lazy load images that are outside the user's viewport.

However, after browsing some reddit threads on the use of `<img>` vs `<Image>`. 
I've found that for most of my use cases, the `<img>` tag with `loading=lazy` may suffice.


Here is a static image, (imported directly from public folder of the site): 

and a refresh button just for fun <RefreshPageButton/> 
(If you look closely, you'll notice that the Next `<Image>` preallocates the space, so there isn't any "layout shifting" as with the default `<img>` tag)

loaded using `<Image>`:
<NextImageStatic/>

vs. lazy loaded with `<img>`:
<DefaultImg/>

and here is the code for both:

**Next `<Image/>`**
```
import React from 'react'
import Image from 'next/image'
import pikachu from '../../../../public/images/pikachu_wizard.png';

interface NextImageStaticProps {
    altname: string
}

export default function NextImageStatic({
    altname = 'pikachu_wizard.png'
}: Partial<NextImageStaticProps>) {
    return (
        <Image
            src={pikachu}
            alt={altname}
            width={200}
        >
        </Image>
    )
}
```


**default `<img/>`**
```
interface DefaultImageProps {
    filename: string
}

export default function DefaultImg({
    filename = 'pikachu_wizard.png'
}: Partial<DefaultImageProps>) {
    return (
        <img
            src={`/images/${filename}`}
            alt={filename}
            width={200}
            loading='lazy'
        >
        </img>
    )
}
```
