import BirdsTable from '@/app/components/Prisma/Birds/BirdsTable'

### Prisma
prisma is something known as an ORM (object relation model).

### Example
Here, I've set up a sqlite model with Prisma with some basic bird info:

<BirdsTable/>

This is the <a href="/api/prisma/birds" target="_blank"><b>api endpoint</b></a>

and I followed this <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMnlyi60avU' target='_blank'><b>YouTube tutorial</b></a> for basic setup.
