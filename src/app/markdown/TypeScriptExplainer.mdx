# Typescript

## why?
Typescript as its name suggests, allows you to add explicit types to your variables.

If you come from Python, you might be wondering, what's the point of manually adding types anyway? 
Isn't it kind of a waste of time if the language can imply what the type is from the value?

Well, perhaps a not-so-obvious benefit about explicitly typing your variables 
is that it often becomes easier to identify the source of an error.

For example, suppose I have a function that only works with numbers:
```
const acceptsNumbers = (number_prop:number) => {
    return number_prop + 1;
};
```

If I try to pass it a string, you'll notice the following error:
<NextImageDynamic filename={'typescript_ex1.png'} width={800} height={101}/>
<NextImageDynamic filename={'typescript_ex1b.png'} width={800} height={190}/>

This is great for identify errors related to type, 
and saves you from spending that extra trying to trace back to the origin of a pesky type error.

It might not seem like that big of a benefit here, but with more complex types (arrays of objects, nested objects, etc.) 
this feature is certainly a huge time-saver.

## basic types
#### primitives
Typescript has 3 basic (or primitive) types:
- `number` (any number, no distinction between ints or floats)
- `string` ('hello i am a string')
- `boolean` (true|false)

You can include them after the variable name like so: `const var1:number = 3;`
However, TypeScript can usually implicitly determine the types here.

The TypeScript docs even go as far as to recommend against typing your variables.

While we're at it, here is a list of things that usually don't require typing:
- variables
- function return values
- anonymous function parameters

So at this point you might be wondering, what am I even supposed to type then? (I certainly asked this when I first learned TS).

The most common place I've found is function/component params and React states, which we'll cover later on this page.

#### array types
The type for an array can be defined:
- `arrayVariableName: number[]` or `arrayVariableName: Array<number>`

Note: `arrayVariableName:[number]` would not define an array as you might expect, 
but rather a *tuple* of exactly length 1 that accepts a number in its one slot.

#### object types
For objects, you  just need to define the type for each of its keys in `{}`, similar to tuples. 
For example, if we had a point object, holding x and y, two numeric coordinates:
- `pt: { x: number; y: number }`

#### the any type
when you're feeling lazy, (or just want to get something to work for the time being), you can give it an `any` type:
- `veryComplexObj: any`

## putting types together
#### union types
when a variable prop can be more than one type (e.g. a `string` or `number`):

```
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log("Your ID is: " + id);
}
```

Here you can call printId with either a number or string. 
The issue is calling methods -- you can't call string exclusive methods like `.toUppercase()`, 
without narrowing the type first:

```
function printId(id: number | string) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    // In this branch, id is of type 'string'
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // Here, id is of type 'number'
    console.log(id);
  }
}
```

#### types aliases & interface
A pretty common handy use case is defining our own type (giving an alias to a type/union of types). 

There are two ways to do this in typescript: `type` and `interface`. 

If we wanted to create an alias for our id above for example:

```
type ID = number | string;
```

Interfaces on the other hand, are for defining object types: 
For example, for our earlier point object:

```
interface Point{
    x: number;
    y: number;
}
```

`type` can also be used for object types though:

```
type Point = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}
```

So you might be wondering, what's the difference??

The key difference according to docs, is you can modify an existing interface, but cannot for type.

**This works:**
```
interface Window {
  title: string;
}
// updating existing Window interface
interface Window {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}
```

**This doesn't:**
```
type Window = {
  title: string;
}

type Window = {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}
```


You can extend both to create more specific versions of a type though, e.g.:

```
interface 3DPoint extends Point{
    z: number;
}
```

and

```
type 3DPoint = Point & { 
  z: number;
}
```

Practically speaking though, here is how I use the two (i.e. quit yer yapping, and give me something useful):
- interface for function/component props (which we cover in the next section)
- type for unions of types I use more than once, (e.g.type theme = 'dark'|'light'|'auto')

## function params and component props

#### functions
**params**

to type functions parameters, simply add the type after each param individually:
```
const addNumbers = (param1:number,param2:number) => {
    return param1 + param2; 
}
```

Or, here's a cool hack: you can type the params altogether if you pass them as an object instead:
```
type NumbersObject{
    number1: number,
    number2: number
}

const addNumbersFromObject = (numbers:NumbersObject) => {
    return numbers.number1 + numbers.number2
};
```

**return**

to type function returns: add the return value after the closing parentheses of the params, `)`, and before the opening bracket for the body, `{`:

```
function (params...): number{
...
}
```

but if you remember, as I mentioned earlier, TypeScript actually recommends that you let return types be implicitly defined.

#### components
Pulled from react's <a href="https://react.dev/learn/typescript" target='_blank'>docs</a>, with some added props, this would be the manual way to do it:

```
function MyButton({ title, color, size }: { title: string, color: string, size: number }) {
    // I didn't implement size and color, but you can imagine...
    return (
        <button>{title}</button>
    );
}
```

You can of course, also use interfaces, similar to with functions, to define component props, like so:
```
interface MyButtonProps{
    title: string;
    color: string;
    size: number;
}

function MyButton({ title, color, size }: MyButtonProps) {
    // I didn't implement size and color, but you can imagine...
    return (
        <button>{title}</button>
    );
}
```

#### (callback) function types
Sometimes, you also need to pass a callback function to a component (e.g. a button component that takes an `onClick` fn as a param:).
This is how you can define that:
```
interface MyButtonProps{
    title: string;
    color: string;
    size: number;
    onClickFn: () => void;
}

function MyButton({ title, color, size, onClickFn = () => {} }: MyButtonProps) {
    // I didn't implement size and color, but you can imagine...
    return (
        <button>{title}</button>
    );
}
```
Note, for function type definitons, we need to insert the param names and types within `()`, and return type after `=>`.
In the case of our click function, we expect no parameters, and no return value, 
but for another function, say an arithmetic type of function, the type look like:

```
interFace MyButtonProps{
...
mathFn: (n: number) => number;
...
}
```

## states
#### state definitions
When we a state variable in JS it looks like this:
```
const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);
```

in TypeScript this turns into
```
const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState<boolean>(false);
```

#### setter functions
Sometimes, we pass a state and setter pair to a component through it's props and thus need a corresponding type for the pair.
A recent example I can think of where I did this was creating a 
search input component that I needed to reuse with different state variables (e.g. home page search vs. sub page search)
This is the type for setter functions:

```
import {Dispatch, SetStateAction} from React;

interface SearchInputProps:{
    ...
    value: boolean;
    setValue: Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>;
    ...
}
```

## Promises
#### Generic types
Before we jump into the type for promises, we should understand ✨*generic types*✨.
First let's pose a scenario, remember for union types, we had types that allowed more than one type for a variable?
Well, what if we had that but, 3, 4, (a very large number)? You might think, ok let's use `any`, 
but the thing is, that still leaves us open to unwanted behavior.

Additionally, you would still need to define a bunch of "overload" functions, 
(functions that each handle the different possible types of our complex type).

That's where generic types come in handy. Rather than predefining all possible types, we do this:

```
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}
```
Type can be replaced by any name not in the default namespace, for example, I commonly see:

```
interface Box<T> {
  contents: T;
}
```

Then, to use this `Box` type later:

```
let box: Box<string>;
```

and we could also define a 'generic' function like so:

```
function setContents<Type>(box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type) {
  box.contents = newContents;
}
```

You can read more about generic object types <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#generic-object-types" target="_blank">here</a>

#### Promise
Now that we understand generic types, the syntax of `Promise<DataType>` probably is pretty intuitive.
A promise can return any type, so we simply define the type within the brackets `<>`.

If you recall array types earlier, one of the options to define an array was also: `Array<T>`.
Hopefully the dots are connecting eh?

### miscellaneous handy dandy stuff

#### `?`
To make a type optional in an interface, simply add a `?` after the variable name like so:

```
interface User{
    id: number,
    name: string,
    favorite_color?: string
}
```

#### Partial
Sometimes, i.e. in a component/function definition, 
many props/args are optional and it's kind of annoying to add a `?` after each prop, 
so something neat you can do is use `Partial<T>` like so:

```
export default function Component(
    {prop1,prop2}:Partial<ComponentProps>
){
...
}
```

#### Required

#### readonly
